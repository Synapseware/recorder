recorder
========

The "recorder" is a simple proof of concept - I'm testing using an external ADC and will expand the project to include external SRAM and an external DAC for setting the gain on the ADC through software (if it makes any sense at all beyond experimentally).

## Board
Adafruit's atmega32u4 breakout + ADS7816p.
